"Don't put all your eggs in one basket." goes an old saying. This is also true in investing on a surprising number of levels. In this post we will look at oppportunities for diversification and their accompanying evidence.

## Diversify across Companies

The most basic level of diversification is to invest in multiple stocks or companies. This avoids catastropic portfolio outcomes caused by the bankcrupcy of a single company and reduces overall portfolio volatility while offering a similar return as a single asset (CFA Institute, 2019).

The cost of insufficient diversification can be substantial, as shown by Goetzmann & Kumar (2008). The authors looked at the retirement portfolios of US-based investors and found the performance difference between the decile with the highest- and lowest diversification was over 3% per year.

In the early days, investors had to buy and trade individual shares to achieve diversification at the company level. Currently the average lifespan of a company included in the S&P 500 index is 24 years and forecast to be just 12 years by 2027 (Anthony et al., 2018). This means a diversified investor had to regularly review his portfolio to keep up with emerging and failing companies. Luckily the introduction of indexing via mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) offers a simple way to diversify across companies.

## Diversify across Sectors and Industries

Sector-specific funds are a popular way to gain exposure to individual industries. While such investements avoid the risk of individual firms, they miss opportunities to diversify between unrelated industries, like banks and health care.

Ben-David et al., (2021) showed that thematic ETFs loose about 30% in risk-adjusted terms in the five years after launch and exhibit higher fees than broader indices. 

## Diversify across Geographies

Investing in different countries and regions provides another opportunity for diversification. E.g. the long term correlation between the German and American stock market is about 0.3 (Solnik et al., 1996). The downside is that correlations tend to increase during crisis and at times of increasing international integration. As a result, investors would need to add emerging markets to the portfolio to keep benefiting from international diversification to the same degree (Goetzmann et al., 2001). 

With regards to actual asset allocations, weighting by market capitalization is generally the cheapest and most common approach. For allocations between regions and countries there is still a case to be made for GDP- or equal weights. GDP weights were found to outperform market capitalization weights by 2.6% over multiple decades. This outperformance was larger for emerging markets and less for developed market indices. One main reason for this outperformance was the avoidance of Japan's asset bubble by capping an overly large stock market to the size of the country's economy (MSCI Inc., 2010).
